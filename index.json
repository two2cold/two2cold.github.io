Transient, large pulses of CO2 commonly observed after soil rewetting (a.k.a. the Birch effect) can represent a major component of the total carbon flux from natural landscapes. Despite such dynamic behavior, most models simulate rewetting behavior through empirical relationships that often fail to resolve nonlinear responses. Implementing more process-based, predictive relationships in modeling frameworks requires the ability to constrain and validate the approach. Here, we present the results of a 20-day soil incubation experiment of samples collected from a Montane setting in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, USA. We sampled the soil to a depth of 80cm in 10cm increments and incubated each depth at 10 effective saturations ranging from 10% to 100%. A critical component of the approach was a repeated wet-dry cycle, by which the initial condition of the second wetting event can be constrained. Results show that during the first wetting event, peak respiration rates are up to four times larger than subsueqeunt steady state. The pulse in respiration in the uppermost soil sample (0-10 cm) was roughly half as large in the second rewetting event as compared to the first. In contrast, the rest of the soil profile showed approximately equivalent responses to the two wetting cycles. We use these incubation results to constrain a processbased reactive transport framework (CrunchFlow), with the addition of a new ability to treat the transition between active and dormant biomass based on soil moisture content, as a means of representing transient Birch behavior. By comparing the model outputs to depth-resolved CO2 concentrations, we test its ability to accurately simulate soil heterotrophic respiration rates under changing moisture contents, particularly during periodic shifts in soil moisture.

Even though this signal has been widely used in paleoclimate studies, the extent to which carbonate δ13C is influenced by the dynamic response of organic carbon respiration rates to soil moisture variations has yet to be fully evaluated. Soils that are rewetted after a prolonged drought commonly display a peak in respiration rate followed by relaxation to a lower steady state in both lab incubation experiments and field observations. This transient behavior, known as the Birch effect, has been extensively observed across a broad range of locations and soil types, and may generate more than 50% of the total respired CO2 in some ecosystems. Here, we seek to identify the influence of the Birch effect on carbonate δ13C records based on a moisture-dependent modeling approach. We report compiled respiration rates of soils from the literature and fit these data as a function of soil moisture, before imposing exponential dampening with depth and applying the resulting function in a production-diffusion equation. We then implement a mass balance calculation for the δ13C value of carbonate precipitated from a mixture of atmospheric and respired CO2, including mass-dependent fractionation associated with diffusive transport. Our results offer a novel prediction for depth-resolved carbonate δ13C as a function of soil moisture, and suggest that Birch effect signals may be recorded in soil carbonates and influence the magnitude of carbonate δ13C variations in speleothems. Thus, we illustrate a prediction for the range of carbonate δ13C recorded in terrestrial carbonates and suggest that differences in the range of carbonate δ13C may indicate changes in soil moisture variability, providing a new framework for quantifying past hydrologic conditions.","tags":[],"title":"Linking the distribution of carbon isotope ratios in soil carbonates and speleothems to climate conditions in the past: A model for the dependence of respiration rate on soil moisture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y Liu","JL Oster","JL Druhan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504242000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504242000,"objectID":"b8354193decbf7d4193711cb8589e8f9","permalink":"https://two2cold.github.io/publication/liu-et-al.-acta.-geochimica/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/publication/liu-et-al.-acta.-geochimica/","section":"publication","summary":"Speleothem carbonates are precipitated continuously from inorganic carbon dissolved in seepage water infiltrating from the land surface, that reflects a mixture of atmospheric CO2, respired soil carbon, and epikarst sources, each with distinct δ13C values.

Zinc was purified using AG MP‐1M resin and then measured by MC‐ICP‐MS. Instrumental mass bias was corrected using the “sample‐standard bracketing” method and empirical external normalisation with Cu doping. After evaluating the potential effects of varying acid mass fractions and different matrices, high‐precision Zn isotope data were obtained with an intermediate measurement precision better than ± 0.05‰ (δ66Zn, 2s) over a period of 5 months. The δ66ZnJMC‐Lyon mean values of eighty‐four and fourteen drilled powders from two nuggets were 0.11 ± 0.02‰ and 0.12 ± 0.02‰, respectively, indicating that NIST SRM 683 is a good isotopic reference material with homogeneous Zn isotopes. The Zn isotopic compositions of seventeen rock reference materials were also determined, and their δ66Zn values were in agreement with most previously published data within 2s. The δ66Zn values of most of the rock reference materials analysed were in the range 0.22–0.36‰, except for GSP‐2 (1.07 ± 0.06‰, n = 12), NOD‐A‐1 (0.96 ± 0.03‰, n = 6) and NOD‐P‐1 (0.78 ± 0.03‰, n = 6).

We present the results of soil incubation experiments using samples collected from the East River watershed in Colorado to quantitatively determine the effect of water availability on microbial oxidation of organic carbon. CO2 concentration and stable carbon isotopes were measured in time series with different soil moisture contents (0, 33%, 66%, and 100%) and depths (0-52 cm, 63-108 cm, 112-165 cm) in incubation experiments. CO2 concentration results show that for a given soil sample, respiration rates can range between 0.03 to 5.31 µmol CO2/g soil/day with an increase between 0 and 66% moisture content, and a decrease between 66% and 100%. These variations show agreement with previous observations. Isotope data show a slight decrease in δ13C for bottom and middle soil samples as time passes, but stay roughly the same for top soils.
